      <h3>CALCULATIONS:-</h3>
      <p>
        1. <b>Height of solids </b> (HS) is calculated from the equation </p>
      <p  style="margin-left: 2%;" > HS = WS/G Y <sub>w</sub> A
      </p>

      <p>
        2. <b> Void ratio. </b>Voids ratio at the end of various pressures are
        calculated from equation</p>  
     <p style="margin-left: 2%;">  e = (H * HS)/HS
      </p>

      <p>
        3. <b> Coefficient of consolidation. </b>The Coefficient of consolidation at
        each pressures increment is calculated by using the following equations
        : <br />
        <br />
        i. Cv = 0.197 d2 
        /t50 (Log fitting method)<br /> ii. Cv = 0.848 d2/t90<br />
        <br />
       (Square fitting method) In the log fitting method, a plot is made
        between dial reading and logarithmic of time, the time corresponding to
        50% consolidation is determined. <br />
        <br />
        In the square root fitting method, a plot is made between dial readings
        and square root of time and the time corresponding to 90% consolidation
        is determined. The values of Cv are recorded in table 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. <b> Compression Index. </b>To determine the compression index, a plot of
        voids ratio (e) Vs logt is made. The initial compression curve would be
        a straight line and the slope of this line would give the compression
        index Cc.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.  <b> Coefficient of compressibility.</b> It is calculated as follows <br>     av =
        0.435 Cc/Avg. pressure for the increment <br> where Cc = Coefficient of
        compressibility
      </p>
      <p>
        6. <b> Coefficient of permeability.</b> It is calculated as follows <br> K = Cv.av
        *(unit weight of water)/(1+e).
      </p>
