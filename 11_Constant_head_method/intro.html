      <h3>Aim:-</h3>
      <p>
        To determine the permeability of soil by contant-head method. <br />
        The rate of flow under laminar flow conditions through a unit cross
        sectional are of porous medium under unit hydraulic gradient is defined
        as coefficient of permeability. Water flowing through soil exerts
        considerable seepage force which has direct effect on the safety of
        hydraulic structures. The rate of settlement of compressible clay layer
        under load depends on its permeability. The quantity of water escaping
        through and beneath the earthen dam depends on the permeability of the
        embankments and its foundations respectively. The rate of discharge
        through wells and excavated foundation pits depends on the coefficient
        of permeability of the soils. Shear strength of soils also depends
        indirectly on permeability of soil, as dissipation of pore pressure is
        controlled by itspermeability.

      <h3>Specifications :-</h3>
      <p>
        IS 2720-17 (1986): Methods of test for soils, Part 17. This test is used
        to determine the permeability of granular soils like sands and gravels
        containing little or no silt.
      </p>

      <h3>Theory :-</h3>
      <p>
        The knowledge of this property is much useful in solving problems
        involving yield of water bearing strata, seepage through earthen dams,
        stability of earthen dams, and embankments of canal bank affected by
        seepage, settlement etc. Permeability of soil can be determined from
        Darcy’s Law. The equation to determine the permeability of soil using
        constant head permeability test is given by:
      </p>
     
     <p style="margin-left: 3%;">   k = (Q×L)/(A×h×t) </p>
   <p style="margin-left: 3%;">   Where,<br />
        k = coefficient of permeability <br />
        Q = volume of water collected in time t <br />
        h = head causing flow <br />
        A = cross sectional area of sample <br />
        L = length of sample
