      <h3>Procedure</h3>
      <p>1. A constant-head test assembly is as given in below figure.</p>
      <p>
        2. Select a representative soil mass of about 2.5 kg properly mixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Fill the soil into the mould and compact it to the required dry
        density by making use of a suitable compacting device.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Set the assembly as shown in figure after saturating the porous
        stones.
      </p>
      <p>5. The water supply is properly adjusted to maintain constant head.</p>
      <p>
        6. Open the valve and saturate the sample by allowing water to flow
        through for a sufficiently long time to remove all air-bubbles.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. When the whole setup is ready for the test, open the valve, allow the
        water to flow through the sample collect water in a graduated jar
        starting simultaneously a stopwatch. Note the time to collect a certain
        quantity of water Q.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. Repeat the test three times and determine the average of Q for the
        same time intervalt.
      </p>
      <p>
        9. Measure the head h, length of sample L, and calculate the cross
        sectional area A of the sample.
      </p>
      <p>10. Calculate k by making use of equation.</p>
