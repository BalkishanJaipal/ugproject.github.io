      <h3>Aim :-</h3>
      <p>
        To determine moisture content –DRY DENSITY RELATIONSHIP BY STANDARD
        PROCTOR TEST. <br />
        Compaction is the application of mechanical energy to a soil so as to
        rearrange its particles and reduce the void ratio. It is applied to
        improve the properties of an existing soil or in the process of placing
        fill such as in the construction of embankments, road bases, runways,
        earth dams, and reinforced earth walls. Compaction is also used to
        prepare a level surface during construction of buildings. There is
        usually no change in the water content and in the size of the individual
        soil particles.
      </p>

      <h3>Specifications :-</h3>
      <p>The experiment is conducted as per IS 2720-7(1980).</p>

      <h3>Theory :-</h3>
      <p>
        The objectives of compaction are: <br /></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 3%;">  a) To increase soil shear strength and therefore its bearing capacity.
        <br />
        b) To reduce subsequent settlement under working loads. <br />
        c) To reduce soil permeability making it more difficult for water to
        flow through
      </p>
      <br />

      To assess the degree of compaction, it is necessary to use the dry unit
      weight, which is an indicator of compactness of solid soil particles in a
      given volume. The laboratory testing is meant to establish the maximum dry
      density that can be attained for a given soil with a standard amount of
      compactive effort.
      <br /></p>
   <p style="margin-left: 3%;">   1. Bulk density ϒt =(M2-M1)/V <br />
      2. Dry density ρd = ρt/(1 +w) <br />
      3. Dry density ρd for zero air voidsline. ρd = Gρw/(1 + (wG/S)) <br /></p> 

   <p style="margin-left: 4%;">  Where, M1 = mass of mould used for proctor test <br />
      M2 = mass of mould + compacted soil. <br />
      M = mass of wet soil. <br />
      V = volume of mould. <br />
      ρw = density of water. <br />
      G = Specific gravity of soils. <br />
      W = water content. <br />
      S = degree of saturation
