      <h3>Aim :-</h3>
      <p>To determine the shrinkage limit of the soil.</p>
      <p>
        The value of shrinkage limit is used for understanding the swelling and
        shrinkage properties of cohesive soils. It is used for calculating the
        shrinkage factors which helps in the design problems of the structures
        made up of the soils or/and resting on soil. It gives an idea about the
        suitability of the soil as a construction material in foundations,
        roads, embankments anddams.
      </p>

      <h3>Specifications :-</h3>
      <p>
        The test is specified in IS: 2720(Part 6)-1972. The 30 g soil passing
        425 micron sieve is used for the test.
      </p>

      <h3>Theory :-</h3>
      <p>
        As the soil loses moisture, either in its natural environment, or by
        artificial means in laboratory, it changes from liquid state to plastic
        state to semi-solid state and then to solid state. The volume is also
        reduced by the decrease in water content. But, at a particular limit the
        moisture reduction causes no further volume change. A shrinkage limit
        test gives a quantitative indication of how much moisture can change
        before any significant volume change and to also indication of change in
        volume. The shrinkage limit is useful in areas where soils undergo large
        volume changes when going through wet and dry cycles (e.g. earthdams).
        Shrinkage limits are required to be determined on two types of soils,
        they are
        <br /></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2%;">    i. Remoulded soil. <br />
        ii. Undisturbed soil. <br /></p>
     <p>   Other shrinkage factors i.e. shrinkage ratio, volumetric shrinkage may
        also be calculated from the test data of shrinkage limit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Shrinkage ratio </b>is the ratio of a given volume change expressed
        as a percentage of dry volume to the corresponding change in water
        content above the shrinkage limit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b> Volumetric Shrinkage</b> is the decrease in volume of a soil mass
        when the water content is reduced from given percentage to the shrinkage
        limit and which is expressed as percentage of dry volume of the soil
        mass.
