        <h3>Aim:-</h3>
        <p>
          To determine the plastic limit of the soil sample and to calculate
          plasticity index, Toughness index of fine-grained soil.
        </p>

        <h3>Theory :-</h3>
        <p>
          Determination of Plastic Limit is as important as Liquid Limit so as
          to ascertain Plasticity Index, Ip of the soil. The plastic limit of a
          soil is the moisture content, expressed as a percentage of the weight
          of the oven-dry soil, at the boundary between the plastic and
          semi-solid states of consistency. It is the moisture content at which
          a soil will just begin to crumble when rolled into a thread â…› inch (3
          mm) in diameter using a ground glass plate or other acceptable
          surface.
