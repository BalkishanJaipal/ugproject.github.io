        Procedure :-

      <p>
        1. Take about 20 g of soil sample, passing 425 micron IS sieve. Mix it
        on the glass plate with sufficient distilled water to make it plastic
        enough to be shaped into a ball. Allow the soil to stand for sufficient
        time to ensure uniform distribution of moisture throughout the soil
        mass.  </p>
      <p>
        2. With about 8 g of soil so prepared, make a ball and roll it on the
        glass plate with hand, with pressure just sufficient to roll the soil
        mass into a thread of uniform diameter throughout its length. When the
        diameter of the thread reaches 3 mm, kneed the soil together to a
        uniform mass and once again roll it. Continue the process until the soil
        thread just crumbles at 3mm diameter.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Collect the crumbled soil threads in a container and determine the
        corresponding water content by oven drying method. </p>
      <p>4. Repeat the test to have three trials.</p>
      <p>
        5. Report the average water content rounded off to the nearest whole
        number as the plastic limit of the soil.
