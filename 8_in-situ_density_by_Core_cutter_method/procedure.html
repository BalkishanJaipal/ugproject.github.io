              <h3>Procedure:-</h3>

              <p>a) Measure the height and internal diameter of the core cutter to the nearest 0.25 mm.</p>
              <p>  b) Calculate the internal volume of the core-cutter Vc in cmÂ³.</p>
              <p>c) Determine the weight of the clean cutter accurate to 1 g (W1 in g).</p>
              <p> d) Select the area in the field where the density is required to be found out. Clean and level the ground where the density is to be determin</p>
              <p>e) Place the dolley over the top of the core cutter and press the core cutter into the soil mass using the rammer. Stop the pressing when about 15mm of the dolley protrudes above the soil surface.</p>

              <p>f) Remove the soil surrounding the core cutter by digging using spade, up to the  bottom level of the cutter. Lift up the cutter and remove the dolley and trim both  sides of the cutter with knife and straight edge.</p>
              <p> g) Clean the outside surface of the cutter and determine mass of the cutter with the soil (W2 in g).</p>
              <p>h) Remove the soil core from the cutter and take the representative sample in the water content containers to determine the moisture content.</p>
              <p>   i) The field test may be repeated at other places if required.</p>
              <p>j) The water content of sample collected is determined in the laboratory as per Experiment no 3 (Determination of water content of soil solids by Oven Drying Method).</p>
              <p>k) Use the above equation, given the theory section, for determining density of soil (pd).</p>
