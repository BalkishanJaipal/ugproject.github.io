      <h3>Aim:-</h3>
      <p>
        To determine the shear strength of soil using the direct shear
        apparatus.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many engineering problems such as design of foundation, retaining
        walls, slab bridges, pipes, sheet piling, the value of the angle of
        internal friction and cohesion of the soil involved are required for the
        design. Direct shear test is used to predict these parameters quickly.
        The laboratory report covers the laboratory procedures for determining
        these values for cohesion-less soils.
      </p>

      <h3>Specifications:-</h3>
      <p>
        The test is conducted as per IS: 2720- 13 (1986), method of tests for
        soils. One kg of air dry sample passing through 4.75mm IS sieve is
        required for this test.
      </p>
      <h3>Theory:-</h3>
      <p>Box shear tests can be used for the following tests.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 2%;">1. Quick and consolidated quick tests on clay soil samples.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 2%;">2. Slow test on any type of soil.</p>

      <p>
        Only using box shear test apparatus may carry the drained or slow shear
        tests on sand. As undisturbed samples of sand is not practicable to
        obtain, the box is filled with the sand obtained from the field and
        compacted to the required density and water content to stimulate field
        conditions as far as possible. So far clay soil is concerned the
        undisturbed samples may be obtained from the field. The sample is cut to
        the required size and thickness of box shear test apparatus and
        introduced into the apparatus. The end surfaces are properly trimmed and
        leveled. If tests on remolded soils of clay samples are required; they
        are compacted in the mould to the required density and moisture content.
      </p>

      <p>Coulombs equation is used for computing the shear parameters.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 3%;">For clay soils</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 5%;">S=c+σtanØ</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 3%;">For sand</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 5%;">S= σtanØ</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 3%;">
        Where, S = shear strength of soil in kg/cm2 </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6%;">  c=unit cohesion (kg/cm2 )
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 6%;">σ=normal load applied on the surface of the specimen (kg/cm2 )</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6%;">Ø=angle of shearing resistance (degrees)</p>
      <p>
        In a Direct Shear test, the sample is sheared along a horizontal plane.
        This indicates that the failure plane is horizontal. The normal stress
        (s) on this plane is the external vertical load divided by the area of
        the soil sample. The shear stress at failure is the external lateral
        load divided by the corrected area of soil sample. The main advantage of
        direct shear apparatus is its simplicity and smoothness of operation and
        the rapidity with which testing programmes can be carried out. But this
        test has the disadvantage that lateral pressure and stresses on planes
        other than the plane of shear are not known during the test.
