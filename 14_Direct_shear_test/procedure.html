      <h3>Procedure:-</h3>
      <p>
        a) Place the sample of soil into the shear box, determine the water
        content and dry density of the soil compacted.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) Make all the necessary adjustments for applying vertical load,
        formeasuring vertical and lateral movements and measurement of shearing
        force,etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        c) Apply a known load on the specimen and then keep it constant during
        the course of the test (for consolidation keep it for a long time
        without shearing, and quick tests apply the shearing without
        consolidation soon after placing the vertically load ). Adjust the rate
        of strain as required of the specimen.
      </p>
      <p>
        d) Shear the specimen till failure of the specimen is noticed or the
        shearing resistance decreases. Take the readings of the gauges during
        the shearing operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        e) Remove the specimen from the box at the end of the test, and
        determine the final watercontent.
      </p>
      <p>f) Repeat the tests on three or four identical specimens.</p>
