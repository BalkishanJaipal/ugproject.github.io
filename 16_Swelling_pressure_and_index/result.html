      <h3>Result:-</h3>
      <h4>1. By Consolidometer Method:-</h4>
      <p>
        The observed swelling dial reading recorded in Table 1 shall be plotted
        with elapsed time as abscissa and swelling dial reading as ordinates on
        natural scale. A smooth curve shall be drawn joining these points. If
        the curve so drawn becomes asymptotic with the abscissa, the swelling
        has reached its maximum and swelling phase shall be stopped, and the
        consolidation phase shall be started. The compression readings shall be
        tabulated as in Table 3 and a plot of change in thickness of expanded
        specimen as ordinates and consolidation pressure applied as abscissa in
        semi-logarithmic scale shall be made. The swelling pressure exerted by
        the soil specimen under zero swelling condition shall be obtained by
        interpolation and expressed in kN/m2 (kgf/cm2).
      </p>

      <h4>2. By Constant Volume Method</h4>
      <p>
        1 The difference between the final and initial dial readings of the
        proving ring gives total load in terms of division which when multiplied
        by the calibration factor gives the total load. This when divided by the
        cross-sectional area of the soil specimen gives the swell pressure
        expressed in kN/m2 (kgf/cm2).
