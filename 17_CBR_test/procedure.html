      </h3>

      <h3>Procedure:-</h3>
      <h4>Preparation Of Test Specimen:</h4>
      <p>
        1. Remoulded specimen: The test material should pass 19 mm IS sieve and
        retained on 4.75 mm IS sieve. The dry density for a remoulding shall be
        either the field density or the value of the maximum dry density
        estimated by the compaction test (Heavy Compaction Test as per IS 2720
        (Part-8) - 1983, for Railway Formation). The water content used for
        compaction shall be the optimum water content or the field moisture as
        the case may be.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Dynamic Compaction: A representative sample of the soil weighing
        approximately 4.5 kg or more for fine grained soil and 5.5 kg or more
        for granular soil shall be taken and mixed thoroughly with water. If the
        soil is to be compacted to the maximum dry density at the optimum
        moisture content, the exact mass of the soil required shall be taken and
        the necessary quantity of water added so that the water content of the
        soil sample is equal to the determined optimum moisture content.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Fix the extension collar and the base plate to the mould. Insert the
        spacer disc over the base. Place the filter paper on the top of the
        spacer disc.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Apply Lubricating Oil to the inner side of the mould. Compact the mix
        soil in the mould using heavy compaction. i.e. compact the soil in 5
        layers with 55 blows to each layer by the 4.89 kg rammer.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Remove the extension collar and trim the compacted soil carefully at
        the level of top of mould, by means of a straight edge. Any holes
        developed on the surface of the compacted soil by removal of the coarse
        material, shall be patched with the smaller size material. Remove the
        perforated base plate, Spacer disc and filter paper and record the mass
        of the mould and compacted soil specimen. Place a disc of coarse filter
        paper on the perforated base plate, invert the mould and compacted soil
        and clamp the perforated base plate to the mould with the compacted soil
        in contact with the filter paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Place a filter paper over the specimen and place perforated plate on
        the compacted soil specimen in the mould. Put annular weights to produce
        a surcharge equal to weight of base material and pavement, to the
        nearest 2.5 kg.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Immerse the mould assembly and weights in a tank of water and soak it
        for 96 hours. Mount the tripod for expansion measuring device on the
        edge of the mould and record initial dial gauge reading. Note down the
        readings every day against time of reading. A constant water level shall
        be maintained in the tank throughout the period.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. At the end of soaking period, note down the final reading of the dial
        gauge and take the mould out of water tank.
      </p>
      <p>
        9. Remove the free water collected in the mould and allow the specimen
        to drain for 15 minutes. Remove the perforated plate and the top filter
        paper. Weigh the soaked soil sample and record the weight
      </p>

      <h4>Procedure For Penetration Test</h4>

      <p>
        1. Place the mould assembly with test specimen on the lower plate of
        penetration testing machine. To prevent upheaval of soil into the hole
        of the surcharge weights, 2.5 kg annular weight shall be placed on the
        soil surface prior to seating the penetration plunger after which the
        remainder of the surcharge weights shall be placed.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Seat the penetration piston at the center of the specimen with the
        smallest possible load, but in no case in excess of 4 kg so that full
        contact of the piston on the sample is established.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Set the load and deformation gauges to read zero. Apply the load on
        the piston so that the penetration rate is about 1.25 mm/min.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Record the load readings at penetrations of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5,
        4.0, 5.0, 7.5, 10 and 12.5 mm.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Raise the plunger and detach the mould from the loading equipment.
        Take about 20 to 50 g of soil from the top 30 mm layer and determine the
        moisture content.
