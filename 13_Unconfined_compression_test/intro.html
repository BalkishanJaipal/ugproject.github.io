      <h3>Aim :-</h3>
      <p>To determine the unconfined compression test of soil.</p>
      <p>
        It is not always possible to conduct the bearing capacity test in the
        field. Sometimes it is cheaper to take the undisturbed soil sample and
        test its strength in the laboratory. Also to choose the best material
        for the embankment, one has to conduct strength tests on the samples
        selected. Under these conditions it is easy to perform the unconfined
        compression test on undisturbed and remoulded soil sample.
      </p>

      <h3>Specifications:-</h3>
      <p>
        The test is conducted as per IS 2720-10 (1991): Methods of test for
        soils, Part 10: Determination of unconfined compressive strength [CED
        43: Soil and Foundation Engineering]. The test is performed on a
        cylindrical sample with a height to diameter ratio of 2: 1. The sample
        is placed between the plates of a mechanical load frame without any
        covering or lateral support. Load and deformation readings are noted
        until the failure of the sample or a strain of 20%, whichever is
        smaller.
      </p>


      <h3>Theory:-</h3>
      <p>The unconfined compression test is by far the most popular method of soil shear testing 
        because it is one of the fastest and cheapest methods of measuring shear strength. The 
        method is used primarily for saturated, cohesive soils recovered from thin-walled 
        sampling tubes. The unconfined compression test is in appropriate for dry sands or 
        crumbly clays because the materials would fall apart without some land of lateral 
        confinement.</p>
